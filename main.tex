%%%%%% Abstract %%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
Integrating deep learning models with existing data interfaces has become crucial for enhancing efficiency and productivity in scientific research. This study focuses on analyzing crop phenology based on growth patterns using time-series satellite data. The primary objective is to classify crops according to their growth patterns and predict crop cycles. Additionally, this approach aims to monitor changes in flora to assess climate change impacts. Through this research, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced deep learning algorithms in identifying crop types and predicting phenological stages. This research contributes to improving agricultural forecasting and enhancing studies on climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.

\section{Introduction}
With the rise of the fourth paradigm of scientific discovery, integrating deep learning  models with existing data interfaces has become crucial for enhancing efficiency and productivity. This paradigm shift emphasizes the importance of data-intensive approaches to drive scientific advancements. In the agricultural sector, analyzing crop growth patterns and phenology through satellite data has the potential to revolutionize crop management and forecasting.

In this study, we aim to determine the most effective algorithm for analyzing crop growth patterns. To achieve this, we need to carefully select the appropriate DL model and vegetation index. The data for our research is provided by the PlanetScope satellite, which captures imagery in 8 spectral bands. These bands offer a comprehensive view of the earth’s surface, enabling detailed analysis of vegetation health and development.

Our study area is located in the southern part of Karnataka, specifically in the Kolar region. This region was selected due to its unique combination of agricultural and urban features, which provides a diverse landscape for our analysis. Kolar is known for its agricultural productivity, making it an ideal location to study crop growth patterns. Additionally, the presence of urban areas within the region allows us to assess the impact of urbanization on agricultural land.

The crop of interest in this study is ragi (finger millet), a staple food crop in the region. Ragi is a Kharif crop, typically sown between May and September. Understanding the growth patterns of ragi is essential for optimizing crop management practices and improving yield predictions. By focusing on this crop, we aim to develop a robust model that can accurately classify crop types and predict phenological stages.
%%%%% Citations in the text %%%%%%
\subsection*{Citations}
Citations of references in the text should be identified using numbers in square brackets e.g., ``as discussed by Cui \cite{Cui1}'' or ``as discussed elsewhere \cite{Cui1,Ninomiya1,Li1,Wang1,Yang1}.'' All references should be cited within the text and uncited references will be removed. 

As an example, this template includes a ``sample.bib'' file containing the references in BibTeX.

%%%%%% Equations %%%%%%
\subsection*{Equations}
Equations should be provided in a text format, rather than as an image. Equations should be numbered consecutively, in round brackets, on the right-hand side of the page by using the ``\textbackslash begin\{equation\}'' command. They should be referred to as Equation 1, etc. in the main text.

\medskip For example, see Equation \ref{eq:1} and Equation \ref{eq:2} below.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
\begin{split}
A & = \frac{\pi r^2}{2} \\
 & = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}

%%%%%% Figures %%%%%%
\subsection*{Figures}
Figures should be called out within the text and numbered in the order of their citation in the text. Every figure must have a descriptive title beginning with ``Figure [Number] …'' All figure titles should be either a phrase or a sentence; do not mix the two styles. See Figure \ref{fig:1} for example.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig 1}
    \caption{This is an example figure.}
    \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

Figures should be displayed on a white background. When preparing figures, consider that they can occupy either a single column (half page width) or two columns (full page width), and should be sized accordingly.

If a figure consists of multiple panels, they should be ordered logically and labelled with roman letters (i.e., A, B, C, etc.). All labels should be explained in the legend. See Figure \ref{fig:2} for example.

Upon acceptance, authors will be asked to provide the figures as separate electronic files. At that stage, figures should be supplied as Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), PostScript (PS), or Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) for illustrations or diagrams; Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), JPEG, PNG, PhotoShop (PSD), EPS, or PDF for photography or microscopy. Bitmap (BMP) images should be of at least 300 dpi resolution, unless due to the limited resolution of a scientific instrument. If a bitmap image has labels, the image and labels should be embedded in separate layers.

%%%%%% Tables %%%%%%
\subsection*{Tables}
Tables should supplement, not duplicate, the text. They should be called out consecutively within the text and numbered in the order of their citation in the text. 

Every table must have a descriptive title beginning with ``Table [Number] …'' as noted in Table \ref{tab:1}. If numerical measurements are given, the units should be included in the column heading. Every vertical column should have a heading, followed by a unit of measure (if any) in parentheses. Units should not change within a column. Vertical rules should not be used. 

Centered headings of the body of the table can be used to break the entries into groups. Do not use footnotes in column heads; include any such details in sentence form in the table legend. Footnotes should contain information relevant to specific cells of the table; use lowercase letters in alphabetical order, as needed: a, b, c, etc.
